## Hands-on Walkthrough

### What is the tagline?

The WordPress site **tagline** is a short phrase located under the site title similar to a subtitle or advertising slogan. The goal of a tagline is to convey the essence of your site to visitors.

### How to modify taglines with the Customizer

The WordPress Customizer allows you to change many aspects of your WordPress site in a single view and avoids having to modify your theme files in code. This lesson uses the [Twenty Sixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/) theme to practice the process. 1\.  Open the dashboard and select **Appearance > Customize** from the menu on the left. [![Selection_025](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2016/08/Selection_025.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2016/08/Selection_025.png) 2\. Select **Site Identity** from the menu. [![Selection_027](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2016/08/Selection_027.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2016/08/Selection_027.png) 3\. You'll see a default _Just another WordPress_ _site_ tagline is set up. Change it by typing in a new phrase in the **Tagline** field. [![Selection_030](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2016/08/Selection_030.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2016/08/Selection_030.png) 4\. This example uses the tagline "This is how you master taglines!". Note it's immediately displayed in the preview window on the right of the page. If you want to save it though, you need to click **Save & Publish**. [tip]Note you may leave the **Tagline** field empty if you prefer that your site doesn't have one.[/tip] [![Selection_029](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2016/08/Selection_029.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2016/08/Selection_029.png)

### Other methods to modify taglines

The Customizer is not required to modify your site, but it offers an easy means to preview changes as they are made. Some themes may not support the Customizer, although it is required for all newly created themes available from WordPress.org. Also, note that each theme designer determines how to implement Customizer functionality, so some themes may vary from the default experience with the Twenty Sixteen theme. So, you may need an alternative method to modify your site's tagline. **General Settings** You can also modify your tagline in the standard **Settings > General** section of the dashboard.

## Exercises

**Exercise: Practice Modifying the Tagline**

*   You may not need to use the tagline or it may not display nicely with certain themes. Use the Customizer to delete your tagline so that is no longer visible on your site.
*   Now, practice adding a tagline back on your site, using the General Settings. Then, use the Customizer to check that the change was made as expected.
